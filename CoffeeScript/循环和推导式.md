###循环和推导式

#### for in 迭代数组

```
eat food for food in [ 'toast', 'cheese', 'wine']

courses = ['greens', 'caviar', 'truffles', 'roast', 'cake']
#dish, i in courses  dish：值  i：键
menu i + 1, dish for dish, i in courses

foods = ['broccoli', 'spinach', 'chocolate']
# if 条件语句用when
eat food for food in foods when food isnt 'chocolate'

#不带括号给countdown赋值10次
countdown = num for num in [10..1] when num isnt 3

#带括号自执行函数返回数组 countdown是数组
countdown = (num for num in [10..1] when num isnt 3)

#迭代范围
evens = (x for x in [0..10] by 2)
```
